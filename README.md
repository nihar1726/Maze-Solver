My Mini Project for Data Structures Lab 
Topic: Maze solver

I was interested in using backtracking to solve a simple maze.
Here, I work with a sqaure maze of 0s and 1s where 1s are walls and 0s are the path.
The maze is provided in driver code itself.
The programs returns a string conveying whether it has found a path to destination or not.
