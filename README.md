Topic: Maze solver
<br><br>
I was interested in using backtracking to solve a simple maze.<br>
Here, I work with a sqaure maze of 0s and 1s where 1s are walls and 0s are the path.<br>
The maze is provided in driver code itself.<br>
The programs returns a string conveying whether it has found a path to destination or not.<br>
